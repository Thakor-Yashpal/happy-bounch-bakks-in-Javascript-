Utilize your skills on non-software projects
While most open source projects almost always involve working on software-based tasks, there are other functions on which you can work that do not involve the same. You can contribute to a project by working on such items as stationery (books, lists), creating lists, and curating creativity programs for users and other contributors as well. 

These tasks can also be performed by software developers (especially beginners) looking to get into open source projects in the long run. Such tasks will provide an opportunity for you to develop your skill and confidence, and they will also help to build on your experience level and portfolio.

Learn the ins and outs of new potential projects
Making a contribution to a project by fixing a bug, no matter how small, can prove an intimidating task. One of the most important aspects and considerations that one should make is what the software at hand is all about, and whether or not a certain aspect needs fixing. 

Before you start to make contributions, it is important to know everything about the said software, right from how it works, its developers, how it is used, and so forth. With this knowledge, you will be in a position to make solid contributions that make an impact and that can also be noticed. 

What are open source projects comprised of?
Every open source project comes with its own community, and every community has its own unique footprint. This is why it is important for contributors to work on various projects in the long run. Different projects have different contributors, lexicons, work systems, communication styles, and so forth. Working on different projects accords you the opportunity to learn the different ways various projects are handled and run. 

Regardless, almost all projects present a similar organizational structure with each player assuming a different role than the other. A typical open source project will have the people outlined below;

Project Owner; 
This is the person who claims ownership of the depository or entire organization. Note that they are not always the author of the project. 

Project Author
This refers to the individual or organization that came up with the project.

Contributors
These are all persons who have made a contribution to the project in one way or another. 

Maintainers
These are the persons charged with driving the project’s vision as well as overseeing the organizational aspects of the whole project. In some instances, the maintainers are also the owners or authors of the project. 

Users/ Community members
The project’s community is largely comprised of persons who use the project. They also offer feedback regarding the project as well as suggest the general direction in which the said project should head.

The people outlined above largely comprise small and medium-sized projects. Larger ones may include more players tasked with various other responsibilities. When going through a large project’s website, you may find such players as organizers, event planners, triage teams, community moderators, and others.
